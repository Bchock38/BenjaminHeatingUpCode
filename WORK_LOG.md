| April 5    |    9-10pm     |                                                                              I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| January 14 |   9-9:30 pm   |                                    Started to think on how to solve problem first thought is to iterate with a for loop |
| January 15 |  9-9:30  am   |      Finished coding first attempt at solving problem set. It passes all but test 4 the largest will see why its wrong. |
| January 15 | 9:30 -9:55 am | Can't pass longest due to not taking into account all possible longest streaks trying to figue out a way to do that now |
